This is how I see that social media could be incorporated into this website. Essentially there are 5 tiers of underreported 
The bottom tier is randomly generated by a machine learning algorithm built to identify potentially important stories from webpages with little traffic
I can read stories on this tier and if I feel that a story deserves more attention, I can suggest that the story move from Tier 1 to Tier 2
Now someone else on the site has a likelihood of seeing the story in their Tier 2 based on my suggestion. If they agree that my recommendation was accurate, it will stay in Tier 2 and has a likelihood of showing up in someone elses Tier 2 feed. 
Now there's a potential for a problem on the site. If person X upvotes a Tier 1 story and person Y reviews X's recommendation, and they have a similar identitiy (political affiliation and background), then that increases the likelihood that X's recommendation will be well-received by person Y. So we want to have users submit a political compass test when making their account, so that we weigh the Y's review of X's recommendation based on how far away they are on the political spectrum. 
Now we can also make that if reviewers often think my recommendations are good, then that will increase the weight of my opinion in the future. 
We could also verify users so that if you are verified as a corporate lawyer and you flag a story as potential corporate corruption that opinion will have a lot of weight compared to someone else.
