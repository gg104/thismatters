How do we increase the likelihood that important issues get reported while ensuring that the most objective takes get through to the people. 

I want to make a website that pools together content from different web sources. 
Specifically I want it to be a means of finding news that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, which I think is especially important with regards to government and corporate corruption and scandals. 
There are two important features I wish to add to the site
#features
<ol>
  <li> A machine learning algorithm to identify bias in a news source (filtering use of emotional language is one possibility) </li>
  <li> A way to upvote stories that haven't gotten a great deal of attention </li> 
  <li> List of takes. 
</ol>
