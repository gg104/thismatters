# thismatters
I want to make a website that pools together content from different web sources. 
There are two important features I wish to add to the site
#features
<ol>
  <li> A machine learning algorithm to identify bias in a news source (filtering use of emotional language is one possibility) </li>
  <li> A way to upvote stories that haven't gotten a great deal of attention
</ol>
#websites
<ul>
  <li> New York Times </li>
  <li> Wall Street Journal </li>
  <li> Government Accountability Office </li>
  <li> center-forward.org </li>
  <li> Transparency Internation </li>
  <li> Reddit r/Corruption
</ul>
