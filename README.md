# Problem
I think there's fundamentally two big problems as a journalism consumer. The first is knowing whether or not what you're reading is objective. I think that there's a lot of ways that we can use the power of ML and the expansiveness of the internet to help ameliorate this problem. The second issue is knowing whether or not we're getting all of the data we should see. The second problem is actually bigger in my opinion. A lot of problems caused by the unethical behavior of powerful institutions are actually known, they just aren't getting the attention that they deserve. I as a single individual cannot possibly read enough content to solve this problem on my own. What's more is that we need to appreciate that even the most powerful people in our governments and corporations don't get all this information. Social media and the capacity for stories to "go viral" can be an agent for a lot of positive change. So I want to create a community wherein the most deserving stories are the most likely to go viral. 

# Solution
I want to make a website that pools together content from different web sources. 
Specifically I want it to be a means of finding news that hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, which I think is especially important with regards to government and corporate corruption and scandals. 
There are two important features I wish to add to the site

# Features
<ol>
  <li> A machine learning algorithm to identify bias in a news source (filtering use of emotional language is one possibility), provide a bias and objectivity rating. </li>
  <li> A way to upvote stories that haven't gotten a great deal of attention </li> 
</ol>
